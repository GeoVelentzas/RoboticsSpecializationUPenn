% 1. Learn how to use the symbolic toolbox in MATLAB
% you will need the state variables, and control input to be declared as symbolic
syms th phi dth dphi u
x = [th phi dth dphi];
% 2. call your "eom" function to get \ddot{q} symbolically
qddot = eom(params, th, phi, dth, dphi, u);
fxtau = [dth; dphi; qddot(1); qddot(2)];
Dxf = jacobian(fxtau, x);
Dxtau = jacobian(fxtau, u);
% 3. Linearize the system at 0 (as shown in lecture)
% You should end up with A (4x4), and b (4x1)
A = subs(Dxf, {th,phi,dth,dphi,u}, {0,0,0,0,0});
b = subs(Dxtau, {th,phi,dth,dphi,u}, {0,0,0,0,0});
A = double(A);
b = double(b);

% 4. Check that (A,b) is  controllable
% Number of uncontrollable states should return 0
Co = ctrb(A,b);
% unco = length(A) - rank(Co)

% 5. Use LQR to get K as shown in the lecture
K = lqr(A, b, eye(4), 1, 0);
